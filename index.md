# Welcome to my website

Here you can find information about me, different projects I am working on, and ways to get in touch. 

## What do I do?
I am a keen musician, with a particular passion in editing and publishing music. Classically trained in piano from a young age, I love going to concerts and playing music with friends. I currently work at Oxford University Press as an Assistant Editor in the sheet music department, working with contemporary composers to expand the choral repertoire. In my spare time, I can usually be found cooking east-Asian food, watching TV with my boyfriend, or stress tidying.

## Projects I am working on
My two main projects at the moment are works by female composers. This is something I feel very strongly about. I believe that by making their works widely and freely available it will increase their chances of being programmed and performed, and prevent these works from being overshadowed by the male-heavy canon. Although positive action may be the chief reason for some of their performances in this day and age, I think that their lack of recognition has to be overcompensated for to improve diversity in the classical music industry.

More details can be found on my IMSLP page. 

### [Clara Schumann Piano Concerto (op. 7)](https://imslp.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto%2C_Op.7_(Schumann%2C_Clara))
This edition was last updated in mid-2019, with full score and full set of parts available on IMSLP. 

It started off as a small passion project for a performance on International Women's Day in 2017, where a set of parts were typeset from a facsimile by me and a small group of friends. Breitkopf and HÃ¤rtel do have scores and parts available for hire, but this option was both practically and financially unfeasible for us. After the performance, I tidied up the parts, implemented suggested corrections and created a full score. 

My edition has since been performed around the world, from my local city Oxford (Oxford University Orchestra) to neighours across the channel in Konstanz, Germany; and across the pond in Kentucky (University of Kentucky Symphony Orchestra), Colorado (Denver Young Artists Youth Orchestra), Massachusetts (New England Conservatory Philharmonic Orchestra), as well as further afield in British Columbia, Canada (Kamloops Symphony Orchestra).

### [Ethel Smyth *Three Moods of the Sea*](https://imslp.org/wiki/3_Moods_of_the_Sea_(Smyth%2C_Ethel))
If you don't know Ethel Smyth, I would really encourage some research into this very unique individual. She was a composer, writer and suffragette during one of the most interesting times in British history for gender politics. An outspoken feminist, she stood her ground in a male-dominated industry, and made history as the first female composer to have a work performed by the New York Met Opera (1903). 
For the final year of my undergraduate degree, I produced an edition and critical commentary of 'Before the Squall', the second number in her song cycle *Three Moods of the Sea* for mezzo-soprano/baritone. The full score is complete, and now I am working on extracting the instrumental parts for no.2, as well as editing the full score for no. 1, 'Requies'. The commentary is available on demand.



Thanks for visiting! Have a good day and go eat a biscuit. (My favourite is the humble bourbon.)
