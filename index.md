# Welcome to my website

Here you can find information about me, different projects I am working on, and ways to get in touch. 

## What do I do?
I am a keen musician, with a particular passion in editing and publishing music. Classically trained in piano from a young age, I love going to concerts and playing music with friends. I currently work at Oxford University Press as an Assistant Editor in the music department, working with contemporary composers to expand the choral repertoire. In my spare time, I can usually be found cooking Chinese food, watching TV with my boyfriend, or doing some work on my editorial projects.

## Projects I am working on
My two main projects at the moment are works by female composers. This is something I feel very strongly about. I believe that by making their works widely available, it will increase their chances of being performed, and prevent these works from being overshadowed by the canon. Although positive discrimination may be the chief reason for any of their performances in the modern age, perhaps their lack of recognition has to be overcompensated until an equilibrium can be achieved. Please contact me if you are interested in performing any of these works. More details can be found on my IMSLP page.

### [Clara Schumann Piano Concerto (op. 7)](https://imslp.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto%2C_Op.7_(Schumann%2C_Clara))
For a performance on International Women's Day in 2017, a set of orchestral parts were typeset from a facsimile but no full score is currently available. I am working on improving all of the orchestral parts, as well as producing a full score to conduct from. Breitkopf and HÃ¤rtel do have scores and parts available for hire, but this option was both practically and financially unfeasible for the performance. There is an upcoming performance of this work in June 2019 at the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford.

### [Ethel Smyth *Three Moods of the Sea*](https://imslp.org/wiki/3_Moods_of_the_Sea_(Smyth%2C_Ethel))
If you don't know Ethel Smyth, I would really encourage some research into this very unique individual. She was a composer, a writer, and a suffragette during one of the most interesting times in British history for gender politics. An outspoken feminist, she stood her ground in a male-dominated industry, and made history as the first female composer to have a work performed by the New York Met Opera (1903). 
For the final year of my undergraduate degree, I produced an edition and critical commentary of 'Before the Squall', the second number in her song cycle *Three Moods of the Sea*. The full score is complete, and now I am working on extracting the instrumental parts. After this, I will edit the rest of the cycle and make the whole set available. The commentary is available on demand.
