# Welcome to my website

Here you can find information about me, different projects I am working on, and ways to get in touch. 

## What do I do?
I am a keen musician, with a particular passion in editing and publishing music. Classically trained in piano from a young age, I love going to concerts and playing music with friends. I currently work at Oxford University Press as an Assistant Editor in the music department, working with contemporary composers to expand the choral repertoire. In my spare time, I can usually be found cooking Chinese food, watching TV with my boyfriend, or doing some work on my editorial projects.
